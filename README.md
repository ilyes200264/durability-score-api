# Durability Score API

This is a lightweight Flask API that calculates a **sustainability score** for physical products based on materials, weight, transport method, and packaging. It uses SQLite to store the history of submissions.

# üìä Scoring System (Starts at 100)

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Conditions & Impacts

| Condition                                      | Score Impact | Suggestion Generated                              |

## üèÖ Rating Thresholds

The final score is converted to a rating based on this scale:

| Score Range | Rating |
|-------------|--------|
| ‚â• 90        | A      |
| 75 ‚Äì 89     | B      |
| 60 ‚Äì 74     | C      |
| < 60        | D      |

## üîß Endpoints

### GET `/`
Basic welcome route to verify that the API is running.

**Response**

Bienvenue sur l'API de durabilit√© !

### `POST /score`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "product_name": "Reusable Bottle", 
  "materials": ["aluminum", "plastic"],
  "weight_grams": 300,
  "transport": "air",
  "packaging": "recyclable"
}
```
Response:
```json
{
    "product_name": "Reusable Bottle",
    "sustainability_score": 90,
    "rating": "A",
    "suggestions": ["Avoid using plastic", "Consider using recycled aluminum", "Avoid air transport"]
}
```
### GET /history
Returns a list of previously submitted products with their score, rating, and suggestions.

### GET /score-summary
Returns a statistical summary of all submitted scores, including:

Average score

Highest and lowest score

Distribution of ratings

Example Response:
```json
{
 "total_products": 12,
 "average_score": 68.3,
 "ratings": {
 "A": 2,
 "B": 5,
 "C": 4,
 "D": 1
 },
 "top_issues": [ "Plastic used", "Air transport", "Non-recyclable packaging"]
}

```
# Installation

git clone https://github.com/ilyes200264/durability-score-api.git

cd durability-score-api

python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment

# On macOS/Linux:

source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows:
Check first if you are on the right directory or not, then open the powershell and enter the commands below :

venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

python app.py

The API will be running at: http://localhost:5000

# Unit Testing

This project includes unit tests to ensure both the API endpoints and the internal logic work as expected.

**To run the tests:**

tap pytest in the terminal in the durability-score-api directory

**Covered Tests**


The test suite (test_app.py) currently includes:

test_score_valid_input: Verifies a valid POST /score returns the correct structure and values.

test_score_invalid_input: Ensures that missing or incorrect fields return appropriate error messages.

test_history_returns_entries: Checks that GET /history returns previously submitted data.

test_score_summary_stats: Validates that GET /score-summary provides accurate statistics, including average score and rating distribution.

test_score_summary_empty: Ensures the summary returns zeros when no data has been submitted.

**Notes**

Tests use an in-memory SQLite database (sqlite:///:memory:) to ensure clean, isolated environments during execution.

No external configuration or setup is needed ‚Äî simply run pytest after activating your virtual environment.

**Technical Notes**

SQLite database is located at instance/history.db

.gitignore excludes the venv/ and __pycache__/ folders

The codebase is intentionally simple and clear for case study purposes
