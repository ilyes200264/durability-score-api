# Durability Score API

This is a lightweight Flask API that calculates a **sustainability score** for physical products based on materials, weight, transport method, and packaging. It uses SQLite to store the history of submissions.

## üèÖ Rating Thresholds

The final score is converted to a rating based on this scale:

| Score Range | Rating |

# Installation

git clone https://github.com/ilyes200264/durability-score-api.git

cd durability-score-api

python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment

# On macOS/Linux:

source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows:
Check first if you are on the right directory or not, then open the powershell and enter the commands below :

venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

python app.py

The API will be running at: http://localhost:5000

# Unit Testing

pytest
Tests are included in the test_app.py file and cover both the API routes and business logic.

üóÉÔ∏è Technical Notes
SQLite database is located at instance/history.db

.gitignore excludes the venv/ and __pycache__/ folders

The codebase is intentionally simple and clear for case study purposes
